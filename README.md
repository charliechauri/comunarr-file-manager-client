## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

**You need to have installed Node's 6.9.5 version.**
* We recommend you to use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) for managing different node versions in MacOS
* For Windows users there are two alternatives:
    * [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows)
    * [nodist](https://github.com/marcelklehr/nodist) - best option

After you are sure to be using at least 6.9.5 version of Node, you can install all dependencies by running:

```
npm install
```

You can run a dev-server by running
```
npm start
```
